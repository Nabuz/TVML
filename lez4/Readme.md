-------------HOW TO ADD A NEW FILE (GOOGLE DRIVE ONLY!!!):-----------------------------------------

In google drive path (TVML/lez4) add a file Fraud_Detection_Name_Surname.ipynb



--------------PROBLEMS TO FIX:----------------------------------------------------------------------------


+The dataframe needs to be rebalanced (Fraud/not Fraud)

+In EDA (Exploratory Data Analisys) problems with some graphs (aren't visualized correctly or show to much!!!)

+Need some way to reduce number of digits: (faster_round(X,4)
faster_round(X_test,4))

+Need to developt the prediction part (some traditional Machine Learning CLassificators vs Deep Learning Classificator)

+Add "Functions used in this Kernel" (here: https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/eda-and-models). It's hard code! With this function you can:
 1) Minimize the ram usage (the csv/dataframe are quite big!!!) 
 2)Calling ML classificator in one shot.

--------------METADATA DESCRIPTION:----------------------------------------------------------------

###Transaction table###

“It contains money transfer and also other gifting goods and service, like you booked a ticket for
 others, etc.”

TransactionDT: timedelta from a given reference datetime (not an actual timestamp)
“TransactionDT first value is 86400, which corresponds to the number of seconds in a day 
(60 * 60 * 24 = 86400) so I think the unit is seconds. Using this, we know the data spans 6 
months, as the maximum value is 15811131, which would correspond to day 183.”

TransactionAMT: transaction payment amount in USD
“Some of the transaction amounts have three decimal places to the right of the decimal point. 
There seems to be a link to three decimal places and a blank addr1 and addr2 field. Is it 
possible that these are foreign transactions and that, for example, the 75.887 in row 12 is the 
result of multiplying a foreign currency amount by an exchange rate?”

ProductCD: product code, the product for each transaction
“Product isn't necessary to be a real 'product' (like one item to be added to the shopping cart). 
It could be any kind of service.”

card1 - card6: payment card information, such as card type, card category, issue bank, country, etc.

addr: address
“both addresses are for purchaser
addr1 as billing region
addr2 as billing country”

dist: distance
"distances between (not limited) billing address, mailing address, zip code, IP address, phone 
area, etc.”

P_ and (R_) emaildomain: purchaser and recipient email domain “ certain transactions don't need 
recipient, so Remaildomain is null.”

C1-C14: counting, such as how many addresses are found to be associated with the payment card, 
etc. The actual meaning is masked.
“Can you please give more examples of counts in the variables C1-15? Would these be like counts 
of phone numbers, email addresses, names associated with the user? I can't think of 15.
Your guess is good, plus like device, ipaddr, billingaddr, etc. Also these are for both purchaser 
and recipient, which doubles the number.”

D1-D15: timedelta, such as days between previous transaction, etc.

M1-M9: match, such as names on card and address, etc.


###Infos about Vesta features###

Vxxx: Vesta engineered rich features, including ranking, counting, and other entity relations.
“For example, how many times the payment card associated with a IP and email or address appeared 
in 24 hours time range, etc.”
"All Vesta features were derived as numerical. some of them are count of orders within a 
clustering, a time-period or condition, so the value is finite and has ordering (or ranking). 
I wouldn't recommend to treat any of them as categorical. If any of them resulted in binary by 
chance, it maybe worth trying."


###Identity Table###

Variables in this table are identity information – network connection information (IP, ISP, Proxy, 
etc) and digital signature (UA/browser/os/version, etc) associated with transactions.
They're collected by Vesta’s fraud protection system and digital security partners.
(The field names are masked and pairwise dictionary will not be provided for privacy protection 
and contract agreement)

“id01 to id11 are numerical features for identity, which is collected by Vesta and security 
partners such as device rating, ip_domain rating, proxy rating, etc. Also it recorded behavioral 
fingerprint like account login times/failed to login times, how long an account stayed on the page
, etc. All of these are not able to elaborate due to security partner T&C. I hope you could get 
basic meaning of these features, and by mentioning them as numerical/categorical, you won't deal 
with them inappropriately.”
